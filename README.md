# ![Angular Example App](logo.png)

> ### Angular codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/realworld-apps/realworld) spec and API.

### [RealWorld](https://github.com/realworld-apps/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged application built with Angular that interacts with an actual backend server including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more. We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the [Angular Style Guide](https://angular.dev/style-guide) & best practices.

Additionally, there is an Angular 1.5 version of this codebase that you can [fork](https://github.com/gothinkster/angularjs-realworld-example-app).

# How it works

The codebase should be straightforward to follow as is. We're currently working on updated documentation for the codebase (explaining where functionality is located, how it works, etc).

# Getting started

Make sure you have the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#installation) installed globally. You can `npm install` to resolve all dependencies (should take a couple of seconds).

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Building the project

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Functionality overview

The example application is a social blogging site (i.e. a Medium.com clone) called "Conduit". It uses a custom API for all requests, including authentication. You can view a live demo over at https://demo.realworld.show

**General functionality:**

- Authenticate users via JWT (login/signup pages + logout button on settings page)
- CRU\* users (sign up & settings page - no deleting required)
- CRUD Articles
- CR\*D Comments on articles (no updating required)
- GET and display paginated lists of articles
- Favorite articles
- Follow other users

**The general page breakdown looks like this:**

- Home page (URL: /#/ )
  - List of tags
  - List of articles pulled from either Feed, Global, or by Tag
  - Pagination for list of articles
- Sign in/Sign up pages (URL: /#/login, /#/register )
  - Uses JWT (store the token in localStorage)
  - Authentication can be easily switched to session/cookie based
- Settings page (URL: /#/settings )
- Editor page to create/edit articles (URL: /#/editor, /#/editor/article-slug-here )
- Article page (URL: /#/article/article-slug-here )
  - Delete article button (only shown to article's author)
  - Render markdown from server client side
  - Comments section at bottom of page
  - Delete comment button (only shown to comment's author)
- Profile page (URL: /#/profile/:username, /#/profile/:username/favorites )
  - Show basic user info
  - List of articles populated from author's created articles or author's favorited articles
